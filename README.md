# Risk-constrained Kelly Gambling
Code and examples from [our paper](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/kelly.html) on risk-constrained Kelly gambling.
The results and plots are embedded in the code:
* `finite_outcome.ipynb` for the finite returns distribution (section 7.1 of the paper)
* `infinite_outcome.ipynb` for the general returns distribution (section 7.2 of the paper).
